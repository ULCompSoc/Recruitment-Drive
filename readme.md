# C+S Fair / RecDrive 

## What is the UL Wolves Clubs and Societies fair?
It is a gathering of all the clubs and societies in the University of Limerick, it gives each group a chance to show themselves off to prospective students in an effort to get them to sign up and join their fun group.

## How do we help setup the event? 
Each club and society have their own pod that they stand at where students can come up to them. We help provide each pod with with internet access. We do this by providing two ethernet cables at each pod. We also set up a wifi access point for group of 6 pods to share also.

The reason each pod for a group needs internet is that they will want to show off content from their laptop, youtube etc. They will also want to log into ulwolves.ie in order to show students how they can sign up. They can also approve memberships at the stand.

## Logistics
This is held in the ul arena, in the main open court. There are individual courts, but the partitions can be removed to allow one massive open space.

We co-ordinate with the Student Life staff to get confirmation on certain things.

We work with the OPC (Outdoor Persuits Club) in the setting up of the event. They work with the setup of the aforementioned pods.

The OPC bring all of these pods from their storage room on campus. They also help us by brining all of the networking equipment from the server room to the ul arena. Thankfully they also bring it back for us in the evening :) 

## How to organise the days before.
Test the cables, this is difficult. We have a cable testing tool but it does not seem to be 100% reliable. I have heard that at the last event it would fail occasionally and if you wiggled the wire around it would pass where it had just failed seconds prior. In the end we used this along with a laptop, router and working port.
* port -> known working ethernet cable -> router -> cable to be tested -> laptop

Test all of the routers, this is easy enough to do.

Co-ordinate with OPC, perhaps get the phone number of a person you can contact. However we have survived very well without ever needing the phone number.

Get the phone number of UL security and add it to your phone.

Make sure you buy duct-tape for the teardown where you have to tape the long coils of cables together again.

Evaluate if you need to repair / buy any new boxes for the ethernet cables.
This can be applied to all equipment, if you think you need to buy something you probably do. Chat to someone.

Organise people to volunteer to help. It is more important to get people for the set-up. If the setup is not complete then people have no internet. It can be harder to get people to volunteer for morning slots so do try and encourage people. This is also where you will learn the most networking knowledge, if that is something you want to advertise/learn more. 

## C+S meeting
There will be a meeting with all of the C+S groups where compsoc get an opportunity to talk to everyone and explain the setup.

## The set up on the day. 

There will be a port opened by ITD/Commnet on the morning of the event 
    This used to be in a storage room with a server rack, however this room is now one of the indoor rock climbing walls.
    This year the cable was connected on the running track upstairs 

    This upstairs location presented its own challenges
        co-ordinating with the maintainence man to tape the ethernet cable up high against a pole so that the cable would not interfere with the track 
        //has its own associated trouble with teardown 
    
There will be a contracter who comes in really early in the mornnig/or the night before and provides power during the event. 
They will add a steel cable across the room, on this cable they attach the power cables to each of the pods locations 

We use the high rise platform a lot during set-up. We add ethernet cables along the steel cable where we attach them to the cable using cable ties
This is the purple ethernet cable group

Describing the purple ethernet cable setup: 
    There are 5 ethernet cables tied together to form 'one' cable
    For each of the pods locations, remove one cable from the row.

             |        |    |
    We know where the pods locations are quite easily becuase the power person has already dropped the power cables at the predefined plots. They are probably measuring this out. Following the pod guide from C+S

At the ground in the middle of the pod these ethernet cables, we attach this to a netgear switch.

Then we have another bunch of black ethernet cables, all tied together. 
We throw this bunch of cables over the steel cable, so it balances.

We do this because we want to run the ethernet cables down the holes of the pods
So that they are able to come out on a small hole on the desk so students can attach them to the laptops
without having a big nest of cables on the floor 

This is repeated for around 4 / 5 steel cables, with 4/5 pods for each steel row. 
Depends on the year and the amount of pods C+S ask us to setup.


## The tear down. 

Start doing things opposite to how you set it up 

Make sure you show everyone how to roll cable 
This could be done before the hall empties / or could be incorporated as part of a compsoc event

Take down the switch / occulus first, and bring the pc and this back to the server room in one go. This will make things easier perhaps 
This can be done the same time other clubs and socs are taking things away, there will still be a small amount of time before the hall fully empties and the tear down can begin.
