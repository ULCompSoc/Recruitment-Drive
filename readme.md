# C+S Fair / RecDrive 

## What is the UL Wolves Clubs and Societies fair?
It is a gathering of all the clubs and societies in the University of Limerick, it gives each group a chance to show themselves off to prospective students in an effort to get them to sign up and join their fun group.

## How do we help setup the event? 
Each club and society have their own pod that they stand at where students can come up to them. We help provide each pod with with internet access. We do this by providing two ethernet cables at each pod. We also set up a wifi access point for group of 6 pods to share also.

The reason each pod for a group needs internet is that they will want to show off content from their laptop, youtube etc. They will also want to log into ulwolves.ie in order to show students how they can sign up. They can also approve memberships at the stand.

## Logistics
This is held in the ul arena, in the main open court. There are individual courts, but the partitions can be removed to allow one massive open space.

We co-ordinate with the Student Life staff to get confirmation on certain things.

We work with the OPC (Outdoor Persuits Club) in the setting up of the event. They work with the setup of the aforementioned pods.

The OPC bring all of these pods from their storage room on campus. They also help us by brining all of the networking equipment from the server room to the ul arena. Thankfully they also bring it back for us in the evening :) 

## How to organise the days before.
Test the cables, this is difficult. We have a cable testing tool but it does not seem to be 100% reliable. I have heard that at the last event it would fail occasionally and if you wiggled the wire around it would work. In the end we used this along with a laptop, router and working port.
port -> known working ethernet cable -> router -> cable to be tested -> laptop

Test all of the routers, this is easy enough to do.

Co-ordinate with OPC, perhaps get the phone number of a person you can contact. However we have survived very well without ever needing the phone number.

Get the phone number of UL security and add it to your phone.

Make sure you buy duct-tape for the teardown where you have to tape the long coils of cables together again.

Evaluate if you need to repair / buy any new boxes for the ethernet cables.
This can be applied to all equipment, if you think you need to buy something you probably do. Chat to someone.

Organise people to volunteer to help. It is more important to get people for the set-up. If the setup is not complete then people have no internet. It can be harder to get people to volunteer for morning slots so do try and encourage people. This is also where you will learn the most networking knowledge, if that is something you want to advertise/learn more.
