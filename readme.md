# C+S Fair / RecDrive 

## What is the UL Wolves Clubs and Societies fair?
It is a gathering of all the clubs and societies in the University of Limerick, it gives each group a chance to show themselves off to prospective students in an effort to get them to sign up and join their fun group.

## How do we help setup the event? 
Each club and society have their own pod that they stand at where students can come up to them. We help provide each pod with with internet access. We do this by providing two ethernet cables at each pod. We also set up a wifi access point for group of 6 pods to share also.

The reason each pod for a group needs internet is that they will want to show off content from their laptop, youtube etc. They will also want to log into ulwolves.ie in order to show students how they can sign up. They can also approve memberships at the stand.

## Logistics
This is held in the ul arena, in the main open court. There are individual courts, but the partitions can be removed to allow one massive open space.

We co-ordinate with the Student Life staff to get confirmation on certain things.

We work with the OPC (Outdoor Persuits Club) in the setting up of the event. They work with the setup of the aforementioned pods. 
(TODO: include pic of pod)

The OPC bring all of these pods from their storage room on campus. They also help us by bringing all of the networking equipment from the server room to the ul arena. Thankfully they also bring it back for us in the evening :) 

## How to organise the days before.
Test the cables, this is difficult. We have a cable testing tool but it does not seem to be 100% reliable. I have heard that it would fail occasionally and if you wiggled the wire around it would pass, where it had just failed seconds prior. In the end we used this along method with a laptop, router and working port.

* port -> known working ethernet cable -> router -> cable to be tested -> laptop

Test all of the routers, this is easy enough to do.

Co-ordinate with OPC, perhaps get the phone number of a person you can contact. However we have survived very well without ever needing the phone number. I think we usually deal through email or social media accounts.

Get the phone number of UL security and add it to your phone. This is needed for bringing stuff back into the SU past 10 o'clock.

Make sure you buy duct-tape for the teardown where you have to tape the long coils of cables together again.

Evaluate if you need to repair / buy any new boxes for the ethernet cables.
This can be applied to all equipment, if you think you need to buy something you probably do. Chat to someone.

Organise people to volunteer to help. It is more important to get people for the set-up. If the setup is not complete then people have no internet. It can be harder to get people to volunteer for morning slots so do try and encourage people. This is also where you will learn the most networking knowledge, if that is something you want to advertise/learn more. 

## C+S meeting
There will be a meeting with all of the C+S groups where compsoc get an opportunity to talk to everyone and explain the setup. 

//TODO: attach the powerpoint to the git repo


## The set up on the day. 

There will be a contracter who comes in really early in the mornnig/or the night before and provides power during the event. 
They will add a steel cable across the room, on this cable they attach the power cables to each of the pods locations 

There will be a port opened by ITD/Commnet on the morning of the event 

This port location used to be in a storage room with a server rack, however this room is now one of the indoor rock climbing walls.
This year the cable was connected on the running track upstairs 

The location of the port we use now is along the wall of the running track upstairs. 

We co-ordinated with the maintainence man to tape the ethernet cable up high against a pole so that the cable would not interfere with the track. This cable then fell down over the railing down to the arena.

If you open the image above and zoom in on the middle pole you can see the cable tied to it about halfway up from the handrail. The cable can be seen falling down towards the ground. 

This cable is brought along the ground towards the root switch. Make sure this cable is not a trip hazard. 

[root switch](/images/the_root_switch.png)

Attach the cable from the root port into the switch. At this stage, plug another ethernet cable into a laptop and see if you get internet. 

At this stage once we have verified there is internet coming from the switch. Someone should carry a large bundle of cable up the stairs from the arena to the running track. 

Lower the cable down under the barrier to the switch, where we connect it up. (I think you will connect all 4/5 cables that are tied together with tape)

There will now be about 4/5 very long ethernet cables up on the track. Run them up the track to the points where the contracter setup the steel cables. 

Someone should go to the same point as the person on the running track but on the raised platform. This would be along the steel cable.

[cable going across](/images/cable_going_across.png)

Put the cable out the gap in the rail. then throw/hand it to the person on the platform, where they wil run it across the arena
Adding zipties to connect the ethernet cable tightly to the steel cable.


[moveable raised platform](/images/raised_platform_safety.png)


When you get to a pod location, you will know its a pod location due to the power cables already being placed there. Lower one of the ethernet cables down. 

At the same time someone on the ground should hand the person on the raised platform the black ethernet cables so they can be balanced on the steel cable.

[cable at pod](/images/cables_at_pod.png)

We do this because we want to run the ethernet cables down the holes of the pods
So that they are able to come out on a small hole on the desk so students can attach them to the laptops
without having a big nest of cables on the floor 

-

Seperately, the person on the running track should also ensure there is no trip hazards by zip-tying the cables to the bottom rail of the hand rail where possible. (I think we zip tie).


Describing the purple ethernet cable setup: 
There are 5 ethernet cables tied together to form 'one' cable
    For each of the pods locations, remove one cable from the row.

    -----------------------------|     |
    -----------------------|     |     |
    ------------------|    |
    ---------|        |    |
             |        |    |
    
    
We know where the pods locations are quite easily becuase the power person has already dropped the power cables at the predefined plots. They are probably measuring this out. Following the pod guide from C+S

<!-- At the ground in the middle of the pod these ethernet cables, we attach this to a netgear switch.


[cables at pod](/images/cables_at_pod.png)

Then we have another bunch of black ethernet cables, all tied together. 
We throw this bunch of cables over the steel cable, so it balances. -->


This is repeated for around 4 / 5 steel cables, with 4/5 pods for each steel row. 
Depends on the year and the amount of pods C+S ask us to setup.


## The tear down. 

Start doing things opposite to how you set it up 

Make sure you show everyone how to roll cable 
This could be done before the hall empties / or could be incorporated as part of a compsoc event

Take down the switch / occulus first, and bring the pc and this back to the server room in one go. This will make things easier perhaps 
This can be done the same time other clubs and socs are taking things away, there will still be a small amount of time before the hall fully empties and the tear down can begin.




[opc - bringing boxes to back entrance](/images/opc.png)

Taking down the root ethernet cable has its troubles as we could not take down the cable, due to it being taped high up on a pole. So we left it for the night and went back the next morning to ask the caretaker to use the ladder to take it down.
